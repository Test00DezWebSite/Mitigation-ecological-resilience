## How ecological resilence affects the mitgation of biodiversity loss.

The following repository contains all the script for the following unpublished manuscript:

`Buschke, F.T. & Brownlie, S. (2019) Reduced ecological resilience jeopardises zero loss of biodiversity using the mitigation hierarchy`

The files are complete and correct as of 21 August 2019. Please direct any queries or corrections to `falko.buschke@gmail.com`


## The following repository contains the following five files:

 1. `Plot_Fig2.R` The R-script to recreate a four panelled figure showing how ecological resilience affects mitgation success for two self-reinforcing habitat states (vegetated vs bare).
 2. `Plot_FigS1.R` The R-script to recreate a four panelled figure showing how ecological resilience affects mitgation success in a population with logistic population growth to a carrying capacity and Allee effeects.
 3. `Resilience_thresholds_simulation.R` The R-script to compare the success of mitigation for different combinations of impact and compensation delay.
 4. `NNLSpaceHabitat.txt` A text file of simulation output generated using file 3 above, which shows which combinations of impact an compensation delay all for no net loss of vegetated habitat cover by 2050. (*file is needed in script 1 above*) 
 5. `NNLSpaceSpecies.txt` A text file of simulation output generated using file 3 above, which shows which combinations of impact an compensation delay all for no net loss of population size by 2050. (*file is needed in script 1 above*)
